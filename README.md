# Git Concepts Practice Project

This is a simple dummy project created to practice important Git concepts such as:

- Initializing a repository
- Adding and committing changes
- Creating and merging branches
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Working with remote repositories
- Pulling and pushing changes
- Using `.gitignore`
- Stashing changes
- Tagging releases

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with a simple interface
- `style.css` - Styling for the project
- `script.js` - Basic JavaScript for interactivity
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Practice various Git commands** as you modify, add, or remove content in the project files.
3. **Create new branches** for different features or experiments.
4. **Merge branches** and resolve any conflicts that arise.
5. **Push and pull** changes with a remote repository.
6. **Tag important milestones** in your Git history.

## Example Commands

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
# make some changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

Feel free to experiment and break thingsâ€”it's all about learning!
